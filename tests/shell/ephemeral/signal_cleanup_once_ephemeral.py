Test that signal-triggered cleanup runs exactly once.

Verifies that:
1. Sending SIGTERM to the coi process triggers cleanup
2. The "Cleaning up session..." message appears exactly once

This guards against a race condition where both the defer and signal handler
could call doCleanup() concurrently without sync.Once protection.
